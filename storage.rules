// Firebase Storage Security Rules
// Version: 1.0
//
// === SECURITY PHILOSOPHY ===
// 1. **Default Deny:** Access to any file is denied unless explicitly allowed.
// 2. **Path-Based Security:** Rules are structured based on folder paths.
// 3. **Ownership & Roles:** Users can only write to their own designated folders.
//    Admins have broader read access for verification purposes.
// 4. **Content Validation:** Rules enforce constraints on file size and type to
//    prevent abuse of storage resources.
